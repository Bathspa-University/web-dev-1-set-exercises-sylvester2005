      <div class="div-instruction" ><h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Marinate the Chicken:</b> In a bowl, mix chicken pieces with yogurt,
            ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, and
            salt. Ensure each piece is evenly coated. Allow it to marinate for at
            least 1 hour in the refrigerator, allowing the flavors to meld and
            infuse into the chicken.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Sear to Perfection:</b> In a large skillet or frying pan, melt butter over
            medium heat. Once the butter begins to sizzle, add the marinated
            chicken pieces. Sear each side until they develop a golden-brown
            crust, about 3-4 minutes per side. This step locks in the flavors and
            juices, resulting in tender, flavorful chicken.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Infuse with Tomato Magic:</b> Once the chicken is beautifully seared, add
            the chopped tomatoes to the skillet. Stir well to combine, allowing
            the tomatoes to soften and release their juices. Cook for an
            additional 5-7 minutes until the tomatoes have broken down and formed
            a rich, flavorful sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Simmer to Bliss:</b> Pour in the cream, stirring gently to incorporate it
            into the sauce. Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer
            gently for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together and
            the sauce to thicken slightly. This simmering process ensures a
            creamy, luxurious texture and intensifies the flavors of the dish.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Garnish and Serve:</b> Once the butter chicken is cooked to perfection,
            garnish it with freshly chopped coriander leaves. The vibrant green
            color and fresh aroma of coriander add a delightful finishing touch to
            the dish. Serve the butter chicken hot with naan bread or steamed
            rice, allowing everyone to enjoy the irresistible flavors and aromas
            of this classic Indian dish.
